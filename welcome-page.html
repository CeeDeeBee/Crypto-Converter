					<p><h1>Terms of Use - Crypto Toolbox</h1></p>
					<i>Last updated: August 6, 2018</i>
					<p><h2>Terms of Use</h2></p>
					<p>These Terms of Use (the "Agreement") sets forth the terms and conditions that apply to your access and use of the Google Chrome Extension called Crypto Toolbox (the "Service").</p>
					<p><h2>Accepting the Terms</h2></p>
					<p>By using the Service, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse or use our software without registering) or you are a "User" (which means that you have registered to create an account with the Service). The term "you" or "User" refers to a Visitor or a User. The terms "we" and "us" refer to Afterbang Software, LLC. You may not use the Service and you may not accept this Agreement if you are not of a legal age to form a binding contract with us. If you accept this Agreement, you represent that you have the capacity to be bound by it or if you are acting on behalf of a company or entity that you have the authority to bind such entity. If you do not agree to this Agreement, please do not use the Service.</p>
					<p>THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS (1) AN ARBITRATION PROVISION; (2) A WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US; AND (3) A RELEASE BY YOU OF ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGE AGAINST US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU AGREE TO THESE PROVISIONS.</p>
					<p><h2>Description of the Service and Your Acknowledgement of Risk</h2><p>
					<p>As part of the Service, we provide you with a suite of tools that allows Users to track various crypto currencies.</p>
					<p>The Service is provided to you for a fee. We cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. We cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings.</p>
					<p>By using the Service, you acknowledge that the Service may not always provide real-time market price quotes, nor does it guarantee that such quotes will be accurate. So, you should verify the price of a cryptocurrency with a second source before buying or selling it. You also acknowledge that cryptocurrencies involve certain costs and risks such as extreme volatility, lack of government regulation, possibility of fraud, lack physical representation, lack of security (i.e., vulnerable to hacking), possible price manipulation, complexity, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, market risk, credit risk, management risk, technical risk, legislative risk and the risk that a position may not be closed when most advantageous. Cryptocurrency investments are not guaranteed by banks or the FDIC and are subject to possible loss of principal, so you should only invest an amount that you can afford to lose. Furthermore, investing in cryptocurrencies requires specialized knowledge, is very speculative and may result in losing even more than the amount invested.</p>
					<p><h2>Third Party Links</h2></p>
					<p>If there is a dispute between participants on our Service, or between users and any third party, you agree that we are under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release us, our officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says:"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."</p>
					<p><h2>Your Use of the Service</h2></p>
					<p>Your right to access and use the Service is personal to you and is not transferable by you to any other person or entity. You are only entitled to access and use our Service for lawful, internal, and non-commercial purposes.</p>

					<p>Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance or repair of the Service or other actions that we, in its sole discretion, may elect to take.</p> 
					<p>You agree that we may use your feedback, suggestions, or ideas in any way, including in future modifications of the Service, other products or services, advertising or marketing materials.

					(h) "Crawls," "scrapes," or "spiders" any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);

					<p>ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER - IMPORTANT - PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</p>
					<p>Arbitration. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</p> 
					<p>If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send an email requesting arbitration and describing your claim to AfterbangSoftware@gmail.com.</p> 
					<p>As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules and if within such court's jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM THAT EACH SIDE MAY HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.</p> 
					<p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with us and you are an individual, you may opt out of this ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER by sending an email to AfterbangSoftware@gmail.com within thirty (30) days of the first of the date you access or use the Service. Severability; if the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.</p>
					<p><h2>Governing Law and Forum for Disputes</h2></p>
					<p>This Agreement, and your relationship with us under this Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Michigan in the United States of America without regard to its conflict or choice of laws provisions. Any dispute with us, or our officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, arising under or in relation to this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively as specified in the ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER clause above, except with respect to imminent harm requiring temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in which case we may seek such relief in any court with jurisdiction over the parties. You understand that, in return for agreement to this provision, we are able to offer the Service at the terms designated, with little or no charge to you, and that your assent to this provision is an indispensable consideration to this Agreement.</p> 
					<p>You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with us, our officers, directors, employees, agents or affiliates, arising out of or relating to your use of the Service or this Agreement:
					YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY; and
					YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE, AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR IN ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER OF A CLASS OF CLAIMANTS, IN ANY LAWSUIT INVOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.</p>
					<p><h2>Copyright Disputes and User Content</h2></p>
					<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA"), as it relates to online service providers, like us, may require us to remove user generated material that allegedly violates someone's copyright. We respect others' intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable User Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers.</p>
					<p><h2>California Consumer Rights Notice</h2></p>
					<p>California Consumer Rights Notice. Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California users of the Service receive the following specific consumer rights notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p>
					<p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2></p>
					<p>If any portion of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, this Agreement as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Agreement that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Agreement.</p> 
					<p>You agree that if we do not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Agreement (or which we have the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of our rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to us.</p>
